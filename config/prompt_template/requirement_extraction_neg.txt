## Today date
```{today_date}```

## Query
```{query}```

## Negative Requirement
```{requirement}```

## Task Background
- **Query** and **Chat History**: come from a dialog between user who is intended to make a travel plan and a travel planer. 
- **Negative Requirement**: a negative requirement extracted from the **Chat History** and **Query** representing what the user does not want or refuse to include in his/her travel plan.

## Task
In the context of the **Chat History**, **Query** and **Requirement** given, please do the following task step by step:
1. Following the rules in **Value extraction**, extract what the user does Not want or refuses from the **Requirement**, **Query** and **Chat History**, then return in the correct format .
2. Determine whether the content of the **extracted value** is metioned in the **Chat History** or **Query**.
4. Determine whether the **extracted value** matched the rules defined in **Value extraction**. 
3. Measure your confidence of the value extraction with a number from 0 to 1.

## Value extraction
- **{requirement_type}** : {requirement_desc}
- The value of **{requirement_type}** should be out put as {requirement_output_format}.

### Output Format:
 Return a dictionary representing an the extracted value, with the following key-value pairs:
 - **extracted value**: extracted from the **Requirement**, representing what the user does NOT want or refuses, by following the rule and output format described in **Value extraction**. 
 - **explicitly metioned in the query or chat history**: Indicates whether the **extracted value** is explicitly metioned in the **Chat History** or in the **Query**. It could be one of `true` or `false`. Note that the extracted value uses a positive tongue to represent what the user does not want.
 - **match value extraction rule**: Indicates whether the content of **extracted value** match the **value extraction** rule . It could be one of `true` or `false`. Note that the extracted value uses a positive tongue to represent what the user does not want.
 - **confidence**: 0-1, measuring your confidence of extracting the value. You must consider how well the extracted value match the definition in **Value extraction** and does the value extracted metioned in the **Chat History** or **Query**.
 - Ensure the output can be parsed by json.loads.
Your output should be a json object in the following format:
{{
    "extracted value": "The value extracted in the format described in **Value extraction**",
    "explicitly metioned in the query or chat history": "True or False",
    "match value extraction rule": "True or False, indicating whether the extracted value match value extraction rule",
    "confidence": "The value from 0 to 1 that measures the confidence of the extracted value"
}}

## Note
- Note that the **extracted value** should only extract the positive expression of the **Negative Requirement** if it is in negative tongue. Example "Do not want spicy food" should extract "spicy food" instead of "do not want spicy food".
- Note that the extracted value uses a positive tongue to represent what the user does not want.
